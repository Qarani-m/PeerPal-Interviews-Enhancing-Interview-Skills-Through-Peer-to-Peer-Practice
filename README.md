# PeerInterviews Platform

Conducting mock interviews is a crucial part of interview preparation. However, many individuals, especially those with limited interview experience, struggle to find opportunities to practice in a realistic environment. There's a need for a platform that facilitates peer-to-peer interviews, allowing users to take on the roles of both interviewers and interviewees.
